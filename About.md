**This application is a tool to convert current units.**

To use it is simple:
- Chose the tab corresponding to the kind of data you want to convert
- Chose the unit in which your value is given
- Chose the unit to which you want to convert your value
- Indicate your value
- Result of conversion is displayed below

This converter was built as a course project for Cousera Data Science Specialisation course 'developing data products', so I only included units that looked like the most frequently met.
